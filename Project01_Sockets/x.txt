# Note regarding PEP 8 compliant names
#  This threading model was originally inspired by Java, and inherited
# the convention of camelCase function and method names from that
# language. Those original names are not in any imminent danger of
# being deprecated (even for Py3k),so this module provides them as an
# alias for the PEP 8 compliant names
# Note that using the new PEP 8 compliant names facilitates substitution
# with the multiprocessing module, which doesn't provide the old
# Java inspired names.
