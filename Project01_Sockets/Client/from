#1 Note regarding PEP 8 compliant names
# 2 This threading model was originally inspired by Java, and inherited
#3 the convention of camelCase function and method names from that
# 4 language. Those original names are not in any imminent danger of
#5 being deprecated (even for Py3k),so this module provides them as an
# 6 alias for the PEP 8 compliant names
#7 Note that using the new PEP 8 compliant names facilitates substitution
# 8 with the multiprocessing module, which doesn't provide the old
#9 Java inspired names.
